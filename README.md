### 👋 Hey, I'm Luis Esteban

I'm a web developer with experience in **React**, **Next.js**, **Tailwind**, and **Supabase**. I work full-time as a frontend developer and spend my free time building side projects as an indie hacker.

I enjoy creating simple, useful products that solve real-world problems — with a **minimalist** mindset and a focus on functionality over flash.
